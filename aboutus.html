<h2>We are a small business based in the North West, UK. We are a couple, Aaron & Ingrid(A&I), and have full time jobs as well as our business!
    We started making candles in 2021 and have since sold them around the world which we are very proud of! 
    We take a lot of inspiration from the coast and Cornwall in particular, a place we love!
    We make our candles to the highest standard and try to avoid the use of plastic where possible.
    Our idea was to make candles that aren't toxic to breathe in like parrafin wax candles can be, 
    and so we looked into alternatives. This is how we found soy wax which is a very sustainable material. 
    We are really proud of how our business has been growing and hope you enjoy our candles as much as we do!</h2>
